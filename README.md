# Env-Guard

No more mistakes while messing around 'production like' environments.

Env-Guard is a chrome extension that lets you modify some parts of your chrome tabs. By doing so,
you can easily identify whether you should be extra carefully or just do whatever you want in your app.

## Motivation:

The chances that you ever needed to log-in into the production instance of your app to either 
fix some urgent problem or maybe to investigate something are pretty high. So, it's very likely that in a normal day at
work you have multiple tabs of your app open and... as we all know sh** happens.

You thought you were browsing on the development instance of your app, where you are the "boss". 
So you deleted and changed bunch of stuff only to later realize that you were actually in the production instance. Oops!
