# Env-Guard

No more mistakes while messing around 'production like' environments.

Env-Guard is a chrome extension that let you modify some parts of your chrome tabs. By doing so,
you can easily identify whether you should be extra carefully or just do whatever you want in your app.

## Motivation:

The chances that you need to log-in into the production instance of your app to either 
fix some urgent problem or maybe to investigate something are pretty high. So, it's very likely that in a normal day at
work you have multiple tabs of your app open and... as we all know sh** happens.

You thought that you were browsing in your development instance where you are the "boss" 
and accidentally deleted some important data. Oops!
